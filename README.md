# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and various *Supervised Machine Learning algorithms*. The goal is to analyze patient health data, identify key risk factors, and build a predictive model for early detection.<br>

#Dataset<br>

The Dataset is mentioned above in the main file . Which contain all the parameters need for the project<br>
## 🔍 Approach
1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Handled missing values and duplicates  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Standardized numerical features  

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualized correlations and distributions  
   - Identified key features influencing heart disease  

3. *Model Building*  
   - Trained multiple ML algorithms:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - Naïve Bayes

4. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Compared performance using Accuracy and F1-Score  
   - Selected the best-performing model
